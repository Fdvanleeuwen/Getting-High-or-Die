# Data

```{r}
# a bad poem:  
# there once was a mushroom that we wanted to eat 
# would it be bitter or would it be sweet 

# a machine learning classifier will help us decide 
# if we will get high or if we will die
# a leave node shows if its red or blue
```

# Simple model

```{r}
print("Hello world")
```

# Improved model

```{r}
# here we are supposed to make a cross validation and maybe some crazy threshold stuff
```

# Something

```{r}
# Judith

# explain method
# assess predictions
# interpret parameters
# if no parameters: interpret contribution of features
# make conclusions about predictions
# use plots
```
