# Data
```{r}
mushrooms <- read.csv("mushrooms.csv")
```

```{r}
mushrooms
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
# a bad poem:  
# there once was a mushroom that we wanted to eat 
# would it be bitter or would it be sweet 

# a machine learning classifier will help us decide 
# if we will get high or if we will die

# soon we will be in the clouds
# or have nasty stuff in our mouths

# liz truss was defeated by the salad

# a leave node shows if its red or blue

# the red ones look nice 
# the blue ones look bad
# if but if i pick red and its poisonous
# i will be sad
```

# Simple model

```{r}
print("Hello world")
```

# Improved model

```{r}
# here we are supposed to make a cross validation and maybe some crazy threshold stuff
```

# Something

```{r}
# Judith

# explain method
# assess predictions
# interpret parameters
# if no parameters: interpret contribution of features
# make conclusions about predictions
# use plots
